## Description
A quick live chat made with websockets, using [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) where you can also draw in a 25x25 canvas.

Choose a username and start drawing!

## Plans for the future
This was a quick project so a few things are still a little rough around the edges or straight up missing.

I would like to improve it in a few ways:

- Create an actual login (right now the username is stored in localstorage). 💻
- Modularize code. Right now it uses global variables and methods that are user accesbile. That's a no-go. 🙅‍♂️
- Improve performance. Sometimes it can be a little laggy. 📈
- Add a heatmap to see which pixels get the most activity. 
- Live visualization of who is painting which pixel.
- Bugfixes. Sometimes it breaks. ❌
